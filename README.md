### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

Here's a little sneak peek into what I'm up to:

- ğŸ”­ I'm currently diving into KaryaKarsa, a platform for storytellers, as a Product Designer.
- ğŸ¦– On weekends or whenever I've got some free time, I'm busy tinkering with various projects for my personal website and taking the first steps in mastering the art of creating awesome design systems for the company I work at.
- ğŸŒ± I'm on a learning spree, soaking up knowledge about Typescript, Dart, and all things related to motion libraries.


ğŸ“« Feel free to drop me a line at muammar.iqb@gmail.com if you want to connect!


Let's chat and collaborate! ğŸš€
